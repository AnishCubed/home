			<!--Introduction to the Parts Page-->
			<p id="intro" class="text"> In this page we will inform you about various
			hardware we found and tell you their functions and uses in an operating 
			computer. To the left is a table of contents that will allow you to navigate
			and choose the hardware pieec that you are interested in. In each section, you 
			will be provided with a description along with some images for you to get
			an idea of what the hardware piece looks like. If you are really interested 
			in the information you see for each hardware piece, you may also check out the 
			wikipedia page about that certain piece that goes into advanced depth.</p>

				<h2 id="mother" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard"> Motherboard </a> </h2>
				<p class="text"> Right off at first glance you will probably see and large
				piece green board, this piece of hardware is call the motherboard. This is 
				the piece which keeps everything together and connected. It is like a road
				for other hardware to communicate to each other and send data throughout. 
				It holds the CPU, memory chips like RAM and ROM, power connection, and other
				elements that may be needed to operate the computer. The silicon material used 
				for the motherboard is ideal because of its semiconductive property is superb 
				in transferring data and power. </p>

				<h2 id="power" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply"> Power Supply </a> </h2>
				<p class="text"> When disassembling our computer, we were unable to take out our power supply. The problem was
				that the screws were in spots where a screwdriver wouldn't reach. 
				Anyways, the power supply is exactly what it sounds like. It supplies power to the computer. It takes AC and changes 
				it into low-voltage DC for parts of the computer to use. The unit regulates the voltage to an adequate amount, which
				which allows the computer to function smoothly. Since this part of the computer is the first to receive 
				electricity, it is the most vulnerable to power surges, spikes, blow outs, etc. Therefore in addition to 
				regulating power for other hardware, it is also built to handle fluctuations in electricity.
				As many pieces of hardware do, these units can overheat. The logical solution being, to attach a fan.
				In our case, the fan at the top was connected to our power supply unit.</p>

				<h2 id="floppy" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk"> Floppy Drive </a> </h2>
				<p class="text"> The floppy disk drive is something that has nearly disappeared. Few people nowadays
				know what one is. Basically speaking, a floppy disk drive is an older, bigger version of a USB. 
				This means a FDD reads on writes data to a small disk. A floppy disk drive was one of the first 
				forms of portable storage. Today as technology has advanced we call our USBs, thumb drives, because 
				that's  how big they are.
				The floppy disk drive  can be on the outside or inside of a computer. In our case, it was on the inside.</p>
