			<!--Introduction to the website-->
			<p id="intro" class="text"> Hello and welcome! This is a website composed from 
			the exploration team that include our members: Kavithan, Lucy, Anish and Jimmy.
			Our tasks was to adopt a lonely computer and explore the various hardware it 
			had within its system. We then identified and labeled the parts and recorded our
			findings. Afterwards, we as a team rebuilt the computer into its original state
			and put all its pieces where they belonged. This website will inform you about 
			what we learned and what pieces we found in that unused computer. We have provided
			a description of what that piece of hardware is and what its purpose it. Hopefully
			you will learn how each of the pieces interact and work in order for computers
			operate today. </p>
			
			<!--Before taking apart the computer-->
			<h2 id="before" class="subHead"> Before </h2>
			<p class="text"> First we had to adopt a computer that was lying on the edges
			of the classroom just collecting dust and taking up space. With help with 
			a screwdriver tool set we were able to open up the computer case and take a 
			first look at what hardware pieces we had. We saw familiar pieces and some
			pieces that we didn't know, then we began taking apart these pieces and taking
			some pictures. Here is what the computer looked like before we did anything 
			to it. </p>

				<h2 id="mother" class="subHead"> Motherboard </h2>
				<p class="text"> This piece of hardware is call the motherboard. This is 
				the piece which keeps everything together and connected. It is like a road
				for other hardware to communticate to each other and send data throughout. 
				It holds the CPU, memory chips like RAM and ROM, power connection, and 
				other elements that may be needed to operate the computer. The silicon material
				used for the motherboard is ideal because its semiconductive property is superb
				in transfering data and power. </p>

				<h2 id="power" class="subHead"> Power Supply </h2>
				<p class="text"> In the corner of the computer you will usually find what is
				called a power supply. This unit basically just distributes the needed voltages
				to each component of the computer. </p>

			<h2 id="after" class="subHead"> After </h2>
			<p class="text"> After a long period of taking apart the computer, we finally
			took everything out and only the casing remained, except the power supply that
			was impossible to take out without having to damage the case. We recorded each 
			piece of hardware by taking pictures of them. This is what the computer looks 
			like with all the hardware is taken out execpt the impossible power supply and what
			the computer looked like when we reassembled it. </p>
