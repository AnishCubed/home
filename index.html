			<!--Introduction to the website-->
			<p id="intro" class="text"> Hello and welcome! This is a website composed from 
			the exploration team that includes: Kavithan, Lucy, Anish and Jimmy.
			Our tasks was to adopt a lonely computer and explore the various parts of hardware inside.
			We then identified and labeled the parts and recorded our
			findings. Afterwards, we as a team rebuilt the computer into its original state
			and put all its pieces where they belonged. This website will inform you about 
			what we learned and what pieces we found in that unused computer. We have provided
			a description of what that piece of hardware is and what its purpose is. Hopefully
			you will learn how each of the pieces interact and work in order for computers
			operate today. </p>

				<p class="text"> First we had to adopt a computer that was lying on the edges
				of the classroom just collecting dust and taking up space. With help from a
				screwdriver tool set, we were able to open up the computer case and take a 
				first look at the hardware. Some of the pieces we recongnized, others we had 
				no clue. Gradually as we progressed in our disassembly, we understood
				which piece did what. Here's a picture of the case, before we took anything out.</p>

				<h2 id="after" class="subHead"> After </h2>
				<p class="text"> After a long period of taking apart the computer, we finally
				took everything out and only the casing remained, except the power supply that
				was impossible to take out without having to damage the case. We recorded each 
				piece of hardware by taking pictures. This is what the computer looks 
				like with all the hardware is taken out except the impossible power supply and what
				the computer looked like when we reassembled it. As you can see, they look the same for
				the most part.</p>
