				<!--Introduction to the website-->
				<p id="intro" class="text"> Hello and welcome! This is a website composed from 
				the exploration team that include our members: Kavithan, Lucy, Anish and Jimmy.
				Our tasks was to adopt a lonely computer and explore the various hardware it 
				had within its system. We then identified and labeled the parts and recorded our
				findings. Afterwards, we as a team rebuilt the computer into its original state
				and put all its pieces where they belonged. This website will inform you about 
				what we learned and what pieces we found in that unused computer. We have provided
				a description of what that piece of hardware is and what its purpose is. Hopefully
				you will learn how each of the pieces interact and work in order for computers
				operate today. </p>

					<p class="text"> First we had to adopt a computer that was lying on the edges
					of the classroom just collecting dust and taking up space. With help with 
					a screwdriver tool set we were able to open up the computer case and take a 
					first look at what hardware pieces we had. We saw familiar pieces and some
					pieces that we didn't know, then we began taking apart these pieces and taking
					some pictures. Here is what the computer looked like before we did anything 
					to it. </p>

					<h2 id="after" class="subHead"> After </h2>
					<p class="text"> After a long period of taking apart the computer, we finally
					took everything out and only the casing remained, except the power supply that
					was impossible to take out without having to damage the case. We recorded each 
					piece of hardware by taking pictures of them. This is what the computer looks 
					like with all the hardware is taken out execpt the impossible power supply and what
					the computer looked like when we reassembled it. </p>
